# UTIOM Lifecycle

The UTIOM lifecycle consists of the following stages:

1. Vision  
2. Strategy  
3. Crown Jewels  
4. Threat Modeling  
5. Threat Visibility Engineering  
6. Threat Detection Engineering  
7. Detection Operations and Threat Hunting  
8. Response and Containment  
9. Resilience and Recovery  
10. Continuous Improvement and Adaptability  

Each stage informs and reinforces the others, forming a continuous operational loop rather than a linear process.

# UTIOM – Unified Threat-Informed Operations Model

UTIOM (Unified Threat-Informed Operations Model) is a practitioner framework for designing and operating modern Security Operations and Incident Response as a unified, threat-informed system.

UTIOM connects strategy, threat modeling, detection engineering, response execution, and continuous improvement into a single operational lifecycle. It is built on management principles, engineering discipline, and operational execution, and is intended to help organizations move beyond tool-driven, alert-centric security operations.

## What UTIOM is
- A threat-informed operating model for Security Operations and Incident Response
- A way to translate governance and strategy into day-to-day SOC and IR execution
- An engineering-driven approach to visibility, detection, and response
- A continuous improvement system treating security operations as a living product

## What UTIOM is not
- Not a compliance framework
- Not a vendor model
- Not a tool or product
- Not a replacement for standards such as NIST, ISO, or SANS guidance

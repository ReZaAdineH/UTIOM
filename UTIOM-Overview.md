# UTIOM Overview

The Unified Threat-Informed Operations Model (UTIOM) provides a structured approach for designing and operating Security Operations and Incident Response as a single, coherent system.

The model is based on the principle that effective security operations require:
- Clear intent and strategy
- Explicit understanding of what must be protected
- Realistic threat modeling
- Engineered visibility and detection
- Decisive and business-aware response
- Continuous learning and improvement

UTIOM treats Security Operations as a living product, continuously designed, operated, measured, and improved.

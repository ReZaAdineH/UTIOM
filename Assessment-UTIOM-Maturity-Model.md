# UTIOM Maturity Model

## Purpose
The UTIOM Maturity Model provides a structured way to assess how effectively an organization designs, operates, and improves its Security Operations and Incident Response capabilities using the Unified Threat-Informed Operations Model.

The maturity model focuses on **capabilities and system behavior**, not on tool presence or procedural compliance.

---

## Maturity Philosophy
UTIOM maturity reflects how deliberately and reliably security operations function as a system.

A mature organization:
- Translates intent into operational design
- Uses threat modeling to drive visibility and detection
- Engineers detection and response capabilities
- Validates effectiveness continuously
- Learns and adapts over time

Maturity is measured across the full UTIOM lifecycle.

---

## Maturity Levels

UTIOM defines five maturity levels applicable to each lifecycle stage.

### Level 0 – Ad Hoc
- Activities are reactive and informal
- Decisions depend on individuals
- Threat understanding is implicit or absent
- Outcomes are unpredictable

### Level 1 – Defined
- Basic processes and responsibilities exist
- Capabilities are documented but inconsistently applied
- Threats are discussed but not systematically modeled
- Detection and response are largely reactive

### Level 2 – Engineered
- Capabilities are intentionally designed
- Threat models and attack paths inform detection and response
- Visibility and detections are engineered artifacts
- Roles and decision authority are clear

### Level 3 – Operationalized
- Capabilities operate consistently across the organization
- Detection and response are reliable and repeatable
- Metrics are used to manage performance
- Feedback loops are actively used

### Level 4 – Adaptive
- Capabilities evolve based on threat and business change
- Detection and response are continuously validated
- Improvement is proactive and data-driven
- Operations adapt without loss of control

---

## Maturity Assessment Dimensions
Maturity is assessed across the following dimensions for each UTIOM stage:

- Intent and alignment
- Threat awareness and modeling
- Engineering rigor
- Operational consistency
- Measurement and feedback
- Adaptability

Each dimension contributes to overall maturity.

## UTIOM Lifecycle Maturity Mapping

### Vision and Strategy
- Clarity of intent and risk tolerance
- Alignment between business objectives and security operations
- Decision authority during incidents

### Crown Jewels
- Explicit identification of critical assets and identities
- Impact-driven prioritization
- Understanding of trust boundaries and blast radius

### Threat Modeling
- Use of realistic attack paths and adversary behavior
- Mapping to detection and response requirements
- Continuous refinement based on feedback

### Threat Visibility Engineering
- Telemetry designed based on threat models
- Coverage of identity, cloud, endpoint, and network signals
- Explicit handling of blind spots

### Threat Detection Engineering
- Detection logic derived from threat models
- Validation and testing practices
- Versioning and quality control of detections

### Detection Operations and Threat Hunting
- Context-rich investigations
- Hypothesis-driven hunting
- Effective triage and scoping

### Incident Response
- Predefined containment and response strategies
- Business-aware decision-making
- Effective coordination and communication

### Resilience and Recovery
- Safe and validated recovery
- Prevention of recurrence
- Reinforcement of trust and controls

### Continuous Improvement
- Structured learning from incidents and exercises
- Measurable improvement actions
- Adaptation to new threats and environments

## Relationship to TID-CMM
UTIOM leverages the Threat-Informed Detection Capability Maturity Model (TID-CMM) as a focused maturity lens for detection capabilities.

While UTIOM assesses the maturity of the entire operational system, TID-CMM evaluates how well threat-informed detection is designed, validated, and improved.

TID-CMM assessments complement UTIOM maturity scoring and provide deeper insight into detection-specific capabilities.

---

## Using the Maturity Model
The UTIOM Maturity Model can be used to:
- Perform self-assessments
- Identify capability gaps
- Prioritize improvement initiatives
- Track progress over time
- Support strategic planning and investment decisions

The model is intended as a **guidance and improvement tool**, not as a certification or compliance checklist.

---

## Key Principles
- Maturity reflects capability behavior, not documentation
- Higher maturity reduces uncertainty during incidents
- Improvement is intentional and measurable
- Adaptability is the ultimate goal

---

## Outcome
By applying the UTIOM Maturity Model, organizations gain a clear understanding of how effectively their security operations function as a threat-informed, engineered, and continuously improving system.
